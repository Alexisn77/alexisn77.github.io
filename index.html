		About Me
	</font></h1>
	<font face="Impact" color="black" size="3">
	I am a Mexican American, who enjoys celebrating hispanic culture events such as Cinco de mayo, Dia de los muertos, and Mexican independance day. Certain goals I'd like to maintain would be improvising and having a more creative mindset in order to cover any issues. The motavation I hold comes from constantly having trial and errors that motivate me to not look back and repeat certain mistakes but to better myself as a person to stop running into problems.
